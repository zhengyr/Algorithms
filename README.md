Map and Navigation Utility for Brandeis Campus

• Extracted location data from files and store them using adjacency list and heap data structure

• Implemented campus navigation using Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm

• Approximated a Hamilton Tour of the campus graph by trying different minimum spanning tree algorithms and other geometric theorems

To see the result, compile and run map.c under the folder "Results"
