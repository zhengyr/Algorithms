// J. Storer, 2011.
// Brandeis Map Edges.

// Edge format is: # label1 label2 v1 v2 length, angle, direction (C) name
// Where C is one of the codes f/F = flat, u/U = up, d/D = down,
// s = steps up, t = steps down, b = bridge
// (lower case is no skateboards, upper case is skateboards allowed),
// or x = default that can be translated at run time (e.g., set to F).

// For readability, north is taken to be vertical straight up,
// and all angles are measured clockwise from vertical.
// However, true north is 25 degrees clockwise from vertical.
// (So the true value of all angles can be obtained by subtracting 25.)

// Note:
// Labels are listed in the vertices file and so are not needed here;
// they have been included just to make this easier to read by a human.
